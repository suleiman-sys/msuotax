Forodhani Gardens<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"firstcharacter\">F<\/span>ound on the coast of the Indian Ocean, this small park sits right across the street from some of Stone Town\u2019s most famous buildings: the Arab Fort, the House of Wonders, and the Palace Museum. Sadly, the latter two structures have fallen into a state of total disrepair, but the 19th century architectural details that remain still make these striking ruins worth a visit. A wonderful food market (pictured above) takes place in the garden itself every night, so be sure to stop by after dark and spend a charmed evening sampling Swahili and Zanzibari cuisine.<\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/3&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;484&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; alignment=&#8221;center&#8221; style=&#8221;vc_box_rounded&#8221; qode_css_animation=&#8221;element_from_fade&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row css_animation=&#8221;&#8221; row_type=&#8221;row&#8221; use_row_as_full_screen_section=&#8221;no&#8221; type=&#8221;full_width&#8221; angled_section=&#8221;no&#8221; text_align=&#8221;left&#8221; background_image_as_pattern=&#8221;without_pattern&#8221;][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/3&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;486&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; alignment=&#8221;center&#8221; style=&#8221;vc_box_rounded&#8221; qode_css_animation=&#8221;element_from_fade&#8221;][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;2\/3&#8243;][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">2. The Arab Fort (Ngome Kongwe)<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"firstcharacter\">M<\/span>entioned previously in Forodhani Gardens, this building is in far better condition today than its two neighbors, and is especially notable for its impressive architecture and history. Constructed in the late 17th century, this fort was built on top of an even older Portuguese church as a means of defense against the occupying Portuguese forces., The remains of the church can still be seen built into the inside wall of the fort. It was later a prison in the 19th century, and even turned into a ladies\u2019 tennis club before the 1964 Revolution. Now, visitors may enter the fort for free and explore the battlements and towers for great views of the harbor and ocean. The amphitheater inside the fort still sees some use today, and if you\u2019re lucky you may catch a live performance on this 400-year-old stage.<\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row css_animation=&#8221;&#8221; row_type=&#8221;row&#8221; use_row_as_full_screen_section=&#8221;no&#8221; type=&#8221;full_width&#8221; angled_section=&#8221;no&#8221; text_align=&#8221;left&#8221; background_image_as_pattern=&#8221;without_pattern&#8221;][vc_column width=&#8221;2\/3&#8243;][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">3. Darajani Bazaar<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"firstcharacter\">D<\/span>arjani Bazaar is the hub of Stone Town\u2019s commerce, selling a wide range of groceries from meat and fish to spices and produce, as well as a variety of wares and crafts to enjoy. Several stands sell souvenirs that make perfect keepsakes to take home as mementos of your time in Stone Town. Some of the sights and smells are surely not for the faint of heart, but it is an amazing cultural experience that should not be missed if you want to experience an authentic East African market.<\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/3&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;487&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; alignment=&#8221;center&#8221; style=&#8221;vc_box_rounded&#8221; qode_css_animation=&#8221;element_from_fade&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row css_animation=&#8221;&#8221; row_type=&#8221;row&#8221; use_row_as_full_screen_section=&#8221;no&#8221; type=&#8221;full_width&#8221; angled_section=&#8221;no&#8221; text_align=&#8221;left&#8221; background_image_as_pattern=&#8221;without_pattern&#8221;][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/3&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;489&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; alignment=&#8221;center&#8221; style=&#8221;vc_box_rounded&#8221; qode_css_animation=&#8221;element_from_fade&#8221;][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;2\/3&#8243;][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">4. The Old Dispensary<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"firstcharacter\">F<\/span>irst built as a dispensary during colonial times, this impressive four story building has a long and interesting history. After serving as a charitable institution as well as a series of apartments, it fell into a state of disrepair during the revolution, but was successfully restored to become a respected, thriving cultural site. Located right on Zanzibar\u2019s seafront, The Old Dispensary is now the town\u2019s cultural center and houses its own restaurant along with several shops and offices. There\u2019s also a hookah bar on the second floor for those looking to explore the night life. This symbol of multi-cultural Zanzibari architecture is not to be missed in your travels to Stone Town.<\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row css_animation=&#8221;&#8221; row_type=&#8221;row&#8221; use_row_as_full_screen_section=&#8221;no&#8221; type=&#8221;full_width&#8221; angled_section=&#8221;no&#8221; text_align=&#8221;left&#8221; background_image_as_pattern=&#8221;without_pattern&#8221;][vc_column width=&#8221;2\/3&#8243;][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">5. Anglican Cathedral of Christ Church<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"firstcharacter\">B<\/span>uilt in 1873 by Edward Steere, the third Bishop of Zanzibar and famous British abolitionist, the Anglican Cathedral of Christ Church was symbolically built on the location of the whipping post from the island\u2019s largest slave market. The unusual architecture includes a unique barrel vault roof and gothic and Islamic details. Steere himself is buried behind the main altar, as he died a few weeks prior to its completion. The grounds also host one of the most famous Slave Monuments in the entire world.<\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/3&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;488&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; alignment=&#8221;center&#8221; style=&#8221;vc_box_rounded&#8221; qode_css_animation=&#8221;element_from_fade&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row css_animation=&#8221;&#8221; row_type=&#8221;row&#8221; use_row_as_full_screen_section=&#8221;no&#8221; type=&#8221;full_width&#8221; angled_section=&#8221;no&#8221; text_align=&#8221;left&#8221; background_image_as_pattern=&#8221;without_pattern&#8221;][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/3&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;491&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; alignment=&#8221;center&#8221; style=&#8221;vc_box_rounded&#8221; qode_css_animation=&#8221;element_from_fade&#8221;][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;2\/3&#8243;][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">6. Changuu Island<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"firstcharacter\">P<\/span>rison Island &#8211; island can be reached on a short 20-minute boat ride from Stone Town. Changuu is home to dozens of giant tortoises, some of which are over 200 years old, and its sandy white beaches and crystal clear water make for some great swimming and snorkeling. History buffs can also visit some of the former cells that housed prisoners in the 19th century.<\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row css_animation=&#8221;&#8221; row_type=&#8221;row&#8221; use_row_as_full_screen_section=&#8221;no&#8221; type=&#8221;full_width&#8221; angled_section=&#8221;no&#8221; text_align=&#8221;left&#8221; background_image_as_pattern=&#8221;without_pattern&#8221;][vc_column width=&#8221;2\/3&#8243;][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">7. Hamamni Persian Baths<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"firstcharacter\">B<\/span>uilt between 1870 and 1888, the Hamamni Persian Baths were the first public baths in Zanzibar, and were used as such until 1920. The name \u2018Hamamni\u2019 means \u2018the place of baths,\u2019 and it was called \u2018Persian\u2019 because it was built by Shirazi architects. Although they are no longer in use, it is possible to see many of the rooms for a small fee. Just ask the caretaker across the alley to unlock the gate for you to see this interesting area.<\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/3&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;490&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; alignment=&#8221;center&#8221; style=&#8221;vc_box_rounded&#8221; qode_css_animation=&#8221;element_from_fade&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row css_animation=&#8221;&#8221; row_type=&#8221;row&#8221; use_row_as_full_screen_section=&#8221;no&#8221; type=&#8221;full_width&#8221; angled_section=&#8221;no&#8221; text_align=&#8221;left&#8221; background_image_as_pattern=&#8221;without_pattern&#8221;][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/3&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;493&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; alignment=&#8221;center&#8221; style=&#8221;vc_box_rounded&#8221; qode_css_animation=&#8221;element_from_fade&#8221;][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;2\/3&#8243;][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">8. Malindi Mosque<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"firstcharacter\">M<\/span>alindi Mosque is one of the oldest mosques in Stone Town. Built by the Sunni sect in a simple style, this is one of three mosques that exhibit cone-shaped minarets, which sit on a square platform. To see them, you need to stand on a baraza (benches found on the side of most Swahili-style buildings) of a neighboring building, which is a beautiful structure worth exploring in its own right. The mosque is well worth a visit while in Stone Town, especially since it\u2019s conveniently located just opposite the town center.<\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row css_animation=&#8221;&#8221; row_type=&#8221;row&#8221; use_row_as_full_screen_section=&#8221;no&#8221; type=&#8221;full_width&#8221; angled_section=&#8221;no&#8221; text_align=&#8221;left&#8221; background_image_as_pattern=&#8221;without_pattern&#8221;][vc_column width=&#8221;2\/3&#8243;][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">9. St. Joseph\u2019s Catholic Cathedral<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"firstcharacter\">S<\/span>t. Joseph\u2019s Cathedral was built between 1893 and 1897 by French missionaries in the Romanesque style, and the plans were drawn by the same architect who designed the cathedral in Marseilles. Its twin spires can be spotted from anywhere in town, and make up a distinctive feature of Stone Town\u2019s skyline. St. Joseph\u2019s main doors are only opened during mass, but when those are closed, it is possible to enter through the back. While you\u2019re here, stop in to admire the intricately carved wooden chests at the workshop across the street.<\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/3&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;494&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; alignment=&#8221;center&#8221; style=&#8221;vc_box_rounded&#8221; qode_css_animation=&#8221;element_from_fade&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row css_animation=&#8221;&#8221; row_type=&#8221;row&#8221; use_row_as_full_screen_section=&#8221;no&#8221; type=&#8221;full_width&#8221; angled_section=&#8221;no&#8221; text_align=&#8221;left&#8221; background_image_as_pattern=&#8221;without_pattern&#8221;][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/3&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;492&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; alignment=&#8221;center&#8221; style=&#8221;vc_box_rounded&#8221; qode_css_animation=&#8221;element_from_fade&#8221;][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;2\/3&#8243;][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">10.

Its eclectic mix of concerts creates an amazing, vibrant ambiance in a beautiful setting. Definitely well worth a visit for the musically inclined, or anyone who supports community initiatives for cultural and artistic enrichment.<\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row css_animation=&#8221;&#8221;
